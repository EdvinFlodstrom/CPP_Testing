Journal
========

This right here, it's a journal. And it's where I'll be documenting my progress on learning the basics of C++. Why? Because I want to try something new, and learning C++ seems like it could deepen my understanding of not only programming in general, but how programming languages function and control systems and such. And because I no longer know what a holiday is. So this is going to be a painful, but also fun (I hope) journey.

C++. Confusion. Not as much as I thought, though. I'm still merely learning the basics, but I've made more progress than I thought I would. In like an hour and a half, maybe two, I've now made a program that successfully converts Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa. Sure, it can definetely be improved, but I've implemented many a techniques that are new to me. I interacted with the STL (Standard Library) for the first time, used lambda expressions and ternary operators, this `std::ostringstream`, wrote to and from the terminal, and defined methods. All in all, good progress, I should think.

I've continued for a few hours now, making some progress. I think it's been fun so far. All I can hope is that I'm doing it all right.
