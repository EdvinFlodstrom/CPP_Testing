Journal
========

This right here, it's a journal. And it's where I'll be documenting my progress on learning the basics of C++. Why? Because I wanted to try something new, and learning C++ seems like it could deepen my understanding of not only programming in general, but how programming languages function and control systems and such. So this is going to be painful, but also fun (I hope).

C++. Confusion. Not as much as I thought, though. I'm still merely learning the basics, but I've made more progress than I thought I would. In like an hour and a half, maybe two, I've now made a program that successfully converts Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa. Sure, it can definetely be improved, but I've implemented many a techniques that are new to me. I interacted with the STL (Standard Library) for the first time, used lambda expressions and ternary operators, this `std::ostringstream`, wrote to and from the terminal, and defined methods. All in all, good progress, I should think.

I've continued for a few hours now, making some progress. I think it's been fun so far, so I hope I'm doing it all right.
